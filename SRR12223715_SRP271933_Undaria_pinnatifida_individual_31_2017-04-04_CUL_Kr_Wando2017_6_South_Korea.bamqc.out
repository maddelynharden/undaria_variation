                                      3)
 -ip,--collect-overlap-pairs          Activate this option to collect statistics
                                      of overlapping paired-end reads
 -nr <arg>                            Number of reads analyzed in a chunk

 -oc,--output-genome-coverage <arg>   File to save per base non-zero coverage.
                                      Warning: large files are expected for
                                      large genomes
 -os,--outside-stats                  Report information for the regions outside
                                      those defined by feature-file  (ignored
                                      when -gff option is not set)
 -outdir <arg>                        Output folder for HTML report and raw
                                      data.
 -outfile <arg>                       Output file for PDF report (default value
                                      is report.pdf).
 -outformat <arg>                     Format of the output report (PDF, HTML or

 -p,--sequencing-protocol <arg>       Sequencing library protocol:

 -sd,--skip-duplicated                Activate this option to skip duplicated
                                      alignments from the analysis. If the
                                      duplicates are not flagged in the BAM
                                      file, then they will be detected by
